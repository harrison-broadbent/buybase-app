Got the project started - the idea came from a random HN comment / article discussing how it would be interesting to build a platform focussed on sharing datasets / tables of data. 
Something called PayTable already exists, but I'm trying to ignore that and just focus on the building and enjoying it. I think I suck the fun out of things by going to business-y too hard. 

I also turned the base devise+oauth+tailwind project into a template which I can clone from github which should make future projects quicker to spin up. 

Done - 
- Basic web app with user accounts and login
- CSV uploading and display

TODO: 
- Sorting and searching of CSV data
- easy sharing of CSV data

Long-term ideas:
- paywall data
- notify payers of data when the data changes via emamil
- Integrate with other services - Notion, Sheets, Coda, Airtable
